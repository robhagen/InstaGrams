# InstaGrams - A handy tool for converting cups to grams and mililiters for the budding cooks and bakers among us!

This tool is something I thought up during the Covid-19 quarantine in early 2020. Because loads of people were ordered to stay inside as much as possible people started baking things to both keep their minds occupied and provide their bodies with delicious schnacks... 

Unfortunately, the best recipes contain measurements of ingredients using cups, an American system that determines amount by volume instead of the rest of the world who determine amount by weight (I'm not sure about this, someone correct me!).

I am fully aware that tools like this exist by the dozens and most of them are done a lot better, nice and slicker than mine, but it was good practise when it comes to JS and GitHub! I fully plan to keep developing the tool to make it more versatile by adding more ingredients to convert, make the page look nice and making it mobile-friendly!

Thanks for checking it out, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question, suggestions or just want to reach out!
